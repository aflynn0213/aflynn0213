# Hi there üëã I'm Alexander J. Flynn

Software Engineer in the aerospace industry since 2019 with experience on several programs including avionics simulation, vehicle management systems, and mission management systems.  Particular domains within each of these programs that I've specialized in is digital communication (Link-16), digital signal processing, sensor fusion, electronic warfare, identify friend or foe (IFF), inertial navigation systems/global position system (INS/GPS), and flight control systems.
